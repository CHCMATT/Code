<p>Build State: <a href="https://travis-ci.org/Liamraystanley/Code"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/Liamraystanley/Code.png?branch=master" alt="Build Status"></a></p>

<p>Code (on #L @ irc.esper.net) is a open source python IRC bot forked from Phenny/Jenni, with new modules, easier to understand commands, and easy installation! Code can run on any operating system that supports Python 2.7 or higher.</p>

<h2>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<hr><p>Code is packed full of features ranging from raw IRC functions to modules that can be unloaded and loaded with ease. Some features include:</p>

<p>Fast &amp; Light Weight</p>

<ul>
<li>Code is very small, so it won't take up resources. Also, Code is very responsive and quick-paced! Also he can run in 1-2 processes!</li>
</ul><p>Load &amp; Unload Modules</p>

<ul>
<li>Code has the ability to load user defined IRC modules, that are pre-made or ones that you create. Code also can live-reload modules for active and fast development.</li>
</ul><p>Very User Friendly</p>

<ul>
<li>It is very easy to install and run Code, even if you have no knowledge of ever running a IRC bot before. ".help" commands, and friendly responses help everything feel smooth and elegant.</li>
</ul><p>Easy-To-use API</p>

<ul>
<li>When creating your own modules, it is always very easy to have a fully documented API and easy to understand functions.</li>
</ul><p>Open-Source</p>

<ul>
<li>Found a bug, feature, or technical support/advice? You can always navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code">Github</a> page to make requests and post bugs. Heck, even fork Code as your own and make your own modifications!</li>
</ul><p>Configuration</p>

<ul>
<li>By default, Code has the ability to change his username (including NickServ Authentication), server (including server password), and excluded channel/modules.</li>

<hr><blockquote>
<p>for rss.py to work (only usable on linux), install feedparser via your pip/yum/other package installer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>If you have any issues during the install, feel free to head to <a href="http://chat.liamstanley.io/">http://chat.liamstanley.io/</a> to get help</strong></p>

<a name="unix--unix-like-os-" class="anchor" href="#unix--unix-like-os-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unix &amp; Unix-like OS: </h2>

<pre><code>1) Make sure you have Python installed `http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/`
   - (packaged in lots of *nix distros)
2) Run `git clone https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code.git`
   - if you do not have git installed, simply install it via your package manager.
     e.i, `sudo apt-get install git`
3) Run `./code`- this creates a default config file 
4) Edit ~/.code/default.py 
5) Run `./code` - this now runs code with your settings 
</code></pre>

<p>Full command would be: </p>

<pre><code>python ./code
</code></pre>

<p>If you wish to run Code on a UNIX shell, the best thing to do would be to fork it to the background process using screen. You do this by execution python/Code with:</p>

<pre><code>screen -S code python ./code
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a terminal window that can be logged into and out without disturbing the process in that window. to exit screen safely, hit <code>CTRL+A</code> then <code>CTRL+D</code>.
To log back into, and view the playback of Code, type <code>screen -x code</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="windows-" class="anchor" href="#windows-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Windows: </h2>

<pre><code>1) Make sure you have Python installed `http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/`
2) Download Code here: `https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code/zipball/master` and unzip it.
3) Configure Code's default.py file, located in your user directory.
   - This is often, `C:\\users\(your username)\.code\default.py`.
   - Note, notepad is not prefered. If anything, use Notepad++ under windows.
3) Now, you should be able to use run.exe (if it's in Code's directory).
   - Else, you can open up command prompt, `cd` to Codes directory, and execute Code with `python code`.
   - Note, if command prompt says that `python` is not a internal or external program,
     that means Python failed to be added to your system-wide %PATH% file.
     So, you need to add it to the %PATH% variable.
     Feel free to google that one, Code is not noob-friendly.

<hr><p>Warning! Once you install Code using the method above, you need to configure him to point to the server you wish to connect him to, as well as add a module path, and administrators/owners.</p>

<h2>
<a name="unix--unix-like-os--1" class="anchor" href="#unix--unix-like-os--1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unix &amp; Unix-like OS: </h2>

<p>Edit the file located at <code>../.code/default.py</code>. this is either the previous directory, or your $HOME directory <code>/home/(user)</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="windows" class="anchor" href="#windows"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Windows</h2>

<p>Edit the file located in your Documents folder, which should be located at: 
<code>C:\\users\myusername\.code\default.py</code> (for Windows Vista/7/8)
<code>default.py</code> might be located in the same spot as the UNIX location listed above.
You should see configuration file.</p>

<p>you should uncomment, and replace the necessary items (like serverpass) to run your bot. </p>
